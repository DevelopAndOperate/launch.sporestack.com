This is super ugly with its Python and Javascript. Especially Javascript, which I know very little of. I'll clean this up in time and will greatly appreciate any pointers or suggestions.

Prior to this, SporeStack has been all CLI driven. Tying it in with Javascript has been interesting.

This is a stateless setup. Don't reload the page when you are buying, either.

Original content released into the public domain, but there's a ton of Javascript that isn't original.

I really need to fix the try/except hack in main.py...
